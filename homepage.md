# Table of Contents

This is the table of contents of my Learning Journal.  My Learning Journal is the files that I have created in my first few days of coding.  It might not be pretty, but I'm just trying to figure it all out.  :smile:

1. [Growth Mindset](https://github.com/AmyE29/learning-journal/blob/master/README.md)
2. [What is a Text Editor?](https://github.com/AmyE29/learning-journal/blob/master/markdown.md)
3. [git and Github](https://github.com/AmyE29/learning-journal/blob/master/leasson3git.md)
